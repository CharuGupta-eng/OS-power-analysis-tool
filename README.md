# OS-power-analysis-tool
Power analysis of design can be reconnoitred at several levels such as system level, architectural level, logic level, circuit level and device level. Power analyser is a tool which determines how much power is utilize by a system or circuit. In this process we give circuits as input along with few operating conditions to power analyser to get report about the power. 

For power analysis i simulate D flip flop using pass transistor, transmission gate, pass transistor with stacking of transistor. Simulate 2-4 line decoder using CMOS logic and TG, DVL alternatively. Simulate 2-1 MUX using pass transistor, transmission gate, MTCMOS logic. Generate netlist and input output waveform along with power usinf formula (V * I) for all schematic circuit.

Simulations done on PSPICE which runs under windows, so no need of linux commands.
For schematic cicuit we use either TSMC 180nm or OSU018 mode parameter file for NMOS and PMOS transistors.

Following are link of netlist and schematic for each schematic cicuit.
I. D FF using PT


II. D FF using TG


III. D FF using stack transistor


IV. Line decoder using CMOS LOGIC 


V. Line decoder using alternate DVL and TG


VI. MUX using PT


VIi. MUX using TG
