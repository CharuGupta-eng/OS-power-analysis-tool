Power analysis of design can be reconnoitred at several levels such as system level, architectural level, logic level, 
circuit level and device level. Power analyser is a tool which determines how much power is utilize by a system or circuit. In this process we 
give circuits as input along with few operating conditions to power analyser to get report about the power.
